# Production Readiness Checklist for Coolify Deployment

This checklist outlines the steps needed to make our PostgreSQL URL Shortener production-ready on Coolify, ordered by priority.

## High Priority (Critical for Launch)

- [x] **Environment Variables & Secrets**
  - [x] Create environment variable template structure
  - [x] Create script to generate secure random passwords
  - [x] Ensure all sensitive values are stored as environment variables
  - [x] Set up secret management for production deployment

- [ ] **HTTPS & Security**
  - [ ] Configure TLS/SSL for all public endpoints
  - [x] Set up proper CORS policies
  - [x] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints (60 req/min with burst capability)

- [x] **Database Resilience**
  - [x] Configure database persistence using Docker volumes
  - [x] Set up automated backups
  - [x] Optimize PostgreSQL configuration for production

- [x] **Error Handling & Logging**
  - [x] Improve error handling in OpenResty
  - [x] Set up structured logging for all services
  - [x] Ensure all errors are properly captured and logged

## Medium Priority (Important for Reliability)

- [x] **Monitoring & Health Checks**
  - [x] Set up health checks for all services
  - [x] Configure Prometheus for metrics collection
  - [x] Set up uptime monitoring

- [x] **Performance Optimization**
  - [x] Configure header and buffer sizes appropriately
  - [x] Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed URLs
  - [x] Optimize database queries and add indexes
  - [x] Configure connection pooling

- [x] **Resource Management**
  - [x] Set appropriate resource limits for containers
  - [x] Configure memory and CPU allocations
  - [x] Optimize Nginx/OpenResty configuration

- [x] **Documentation**
  - [x] Create comprehensive README
  - [x] Document API endpoints and expected behaviors
  - [x] Create deployment guide specific to Coolify
  - [x] Create troubleshooting guide

## Low Priority (Nice to Have)

- [ ] **Analytics & Reporting**
  - [x] Implement basic click tracking
  - [ ] Set up basic analytics dashboard
  - [ ] Create periodic reporting

- [ ] **Advanced Features**
  - [ ] Implement user management
  - [ ] Add link expiration functionality
  - [ ] Create bulk operations for URL creation

- [x] **Scalability Planning**
  - [x] Document horizontal scaling approach
  - [x] Identify potential bottlenecks
  - [x] Plan for future growth

## Testing Protocol

After each change, we'll test the application using the following curl commands:

1. Test the API endpoint for creating short links:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/rpc/create_short_link" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"p_original_url": "https://example.com/test"}'
```

2. Test URL redirection functionality:
```bash
curl -v "http://localhost:8000/r/{code}"
```

3. Test the health of services:
```bash
curl -v "http://localhost:8000/health"
curl -v "http://localhost:3001/"
```

All tests should be performed before and after each change to ensure we're not breaking existing functionality.
