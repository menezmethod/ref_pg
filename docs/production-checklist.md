  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

## Low Priority (Nice to Have)

- [ ] **Analytics & Reporting**
  - [ ] Implement enhanced click tracking
  - [ ] Set up basic analytics dashboard
  - [ ] Create periodic reporting

- [ ] **Advanced Features**
  - [ ] Implement user management
  - [ ] Add link expiration functionality
  - [ ] Create bulk operations for URL creation

- [ ] **Scalability Planning**
  - [ ] Document horizontal scaling approach
  - [ ] Identify potential bottlenecks
  - [ ] Plan for future growth

## Testing Protocol

After each change, we'll test the application using the following curl commands:

1. Test the API endpoint for creating short links:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/rpc/create_short_link" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"p_original_url": "https://example.com/test"}'
```

2. Test URL redirection functionality:
```bash
curl -v "http://localhost:8000/r/{code}"
```

3. Test the health of services:
```bash
curl -v "http://localhost:3001/"
```

All tests should be performed before and after each change to ensure we're not breaking existing functionality.
