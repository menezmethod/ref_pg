# Patch Notes - URL Shortener Coolify Deployment Fixes

## Version 1.1.0 - 2025-03-09

This patch addresses several issues with deploying the URL Shortener application on Coolify and implements a fully automated deployment solution. The following changes have been made to improve deployment reliability:

### Bug Fixes

1. **PostgreSQL Database Creation Issue**
   - Modified PostgreSQL initialization to ensure the database is created automatically
   - Updated init scripts with numbered prefixes to enforce correct execution order
   - Added robust retry logic for database connection and schema initialization

2. **PostgREST Configuration Fix**
   - Implemented dual configuration approach using both environment variables and a fallback config file
   - Added environment variables for all required PostgREST settings
   - Created a template configuration file that pulls values from environment variables

3. **Dependencies and Startup Order**
   - Added proper health checks to all services
   - Implemented proper dependency order with service health conditions
   - Ensured services wait for their dependencies to be healthy before starting

4. **Validation and Monitoring**
   - Added validation script to verify proper setup
   - Implemented comprehensive health checks for all services

### Automatic Deployment

The changes ensure that deployment is fully automated in Coolify:

1. PostgreSQL container automatically:
   - Creates the database
   - Applies the schema
   - Sets the master password

2. PostgREST automatically:
   - Connects to the database
   - Uses the correct schema
   - Authenticates with the correct credentials

3. Other services automatically wait for their dependencies to be healthy before starting

### Environment Variables

Ensure these variables are correctly set in your Coolify environment:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_USER`  
- `POSTGRES_DB` (should be "url_shortener")
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `MASTER_PASSWORD`
- `PGADMIN_EMAIL`
- `PGADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`
